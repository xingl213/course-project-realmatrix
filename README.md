# What you can do with Recaller (memorization software)

- Create an account and log in your account
- Create packages in your account
- Create cards in a package
- Review or learn the cards you created

# Memo

- The only limitation on how to use this software is your imagination! That said, Recaller can help you memorize vocabulary, facts, and other forms of information
- Please name the **term** of each card using only alpha-numeric characters. Else the card can't be saved into database (yes it's a limitation and we're looking to improve it)
- Have fun!
